## Background

A CanSat is a diminutive satellite designed to snugly fit within the dimensions of a standard can. It serves as a reduced-scale prototype for the conception, fabrication, and launch of an authentic satellite, featuring an array of electronic components such as Magneto Resistive (MR) sensors, gyroscope, accelerometer, pressure sensor, and microswitch.

These components are classified into two main groups: the first cohort aids in the launch and control of the CanSat, while the second cluster is dedicated to its operational aspects, including data collection, processing, and transmission. Notable subsystems encompass Payload, Electrical Power, Structure, Communication, and On-Board Computer.
